# mpi-bw-latency-tests

## Description

OpenMPI (v1.5) bandwith and latency tests:

* 1: Process X sends to process Y bursts of N packets whose size is M bytes.
* 2: Process Y receives them and then sends to process X an integer as acknowledgement.
* 3: Go to 1 until R repetitions of the test are done.
* 4: Measures bandwith, mean latency, worst latency and best latency.

Number of pairs of processes is parametrized, as well as N (number of packets), M (packet size) and R (number of repetitions).
